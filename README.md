## Pausing the Development of DriftoutIO 

Hello DriftoutIO Community,

It is with a heavy heart that I must announce that I will be pausing the development of DriftoutIO indefinitely. Over the past months, I've poured my time and passion into bringing this game back to life, and I've enjoyed every moment of it. However, due to increasing work commitments and the rising costs associated with maintaining and further developing the game, I am no longer able to continue at this time.
